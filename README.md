**_Zoothamnium niveum_ Cultivation System: 3D Models and Technical Drawings**

This repository contains open-source 3D models and technical drawings for constructing the cultivation chamber developed for the symbiotic ciliate _Zoothamnium niveum_. These models enable researchers to recreate the cultivation setup, supporting studies of full-cycle chemosynthetic symbiosis.

**Project Contents**
The files are organized into individual parts and assemblies to facilitate both individual and complete 3D printing.

**Files Included**

- Technical Drawings

- STL Files for 3D printing:

_Individual Parts_: STL files for each part separately, ideal for customizing or replacing specific components.

_Two_Frames_: An STL file containing two frames, necessary for assembling a single chamber.

_Mold_Assembly_ (Single STL): An STL file with the central part of the mold along with two side components, allowing the entire mold (three pieces) to be printed in a single job.

**Printing Instructions**
For optimal performance, it's recommended to use detailed printing parameters. This will ensure that the mold and frame components are robust, fit together accurately, and have well-defined details necessary for precise assembly and functionality.

_As an example, below are the printing parameters we used for the Mold_Assembly:_

Extruder 1 Material: PLA

Raft: no

Printer type: Original Prusa MK4

Layer height: 0.1 mm

Infill Density: 18%

Wall thickness: 0.8 mm

Extruder 1 temperature: 210 °C

Printing duration: 15:23:44

Heated bed temperature: 60 °C

Weight: 102.88 g

Cost: $2.06
